 * cluster. Sessions without coordinates are skipped. Within a cluster the
 * representative `id` is the most-recent charge, so tapping the marker opens the
 * latest visit. Output is sorted by `count` descending (deterministic, render-friendly).
 *
 * Default radius is 150m: charges at one spot (a Supercharger, your driveway) drift
 * by GPS jitter — this user's home readings span ~128m across months — so a tighter
 * 100m would split one place into two pins, while distinct places sit ≥500m apart.
